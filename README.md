# Running Dashboard in Power BI
running data made with AI

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** built from my personal running workouts (2022).  
The goal was to analyze training volume, intensity, and trends using self-collected data.

## Features
- **KPI cards**: Total Distance, Avg Heart Rate, Avg Pace, 28D Rolling Distance, Best Week
- **Trends**: Weekly distance and cumulative distance over time
- **Breakdowns**: Distance by workout type, weather conditions
- **Detail table**: Raw workouts (date, type, distance, duration, pace, HR, elevation)

## Tools & Methods
- Power BI, Power Query for cleaning (datatypes, locale handling)
- DAX measures for calculations (e.g. cumulative distance, rolling 28-day totals, pace formatting)
- Custom color theme for professional look
